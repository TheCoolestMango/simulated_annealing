# Simulated annealing

The algorithm is used to find the optimal traveling salesman path across the 30 most populated cities in Russia.
The database used for the information about cities, such as their population, their geographical coordinates is available [here](https://github.com/hflabs/city])

The generated paths for each cooling (annealing) rate are compared in two ways:

* By plotting the resulting total distances of generated paths over each iteration (see figure below):

* By animating the changes in graphs of paths.
